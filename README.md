# Line Coding Visualizer  
A web-based interactive tool to visualize various line coding schemes  
Developed for the Data Communication Lab Course

---

## 📌 Overview

**Line Coding Visualizer** is an educational web application that demonstrates how different line coding techniques encode digital data signals for transmission over communication channels. It provides interactive graphs to visualize the waveform of each coding scheme based on user input binary sequences.

The project was developed to help students and professionals grasp the concepts of line coding by visually comparing schemes such as Unipolar NRZ, Polar NRZ, Manchester, Differential Manchester, and more.

This hands-on tool enhances understanding of digital signal encoding techniques used in data communication systems.
